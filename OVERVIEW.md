## What problem is the product aimed at solving?
I'm running a group of swing dancing practices. Would it be nice to have a centralized place for collecting and managing all bookings and payments.
The app should have:
- Provide clear schedules of room bookings, and estimated capacity
- Personalized estimated cost per head
- A simple button to checkin for practice
- Personalized report after practices

## Who is the product geared towards (targeted audience)?
A closed group of known associates

## How is my product unique?
Browser-based: so platform agnostics
Built-with-security: personalized view for users

## First Step:
- allow users to declare themselves
- keep track of checkin
- fetch data from Google Sheet
